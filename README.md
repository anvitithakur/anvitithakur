- 👋 Hi, I’m Anviti @anvitithakur : a mother, educator, banker , strategic consultant and software developer
- 👀 I’m interested in a multitude of things that span across logic and analytics to people interactions and insights including works of fiction as a mirror real world
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about statistics and its applications in ML and AI.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on innovative projects that help me contribute meaningfully as well as provide an opportunity to learn more
- 📫 You can reach me at anviti.thakur@gmail.com/8080268484
- ⚡ Fun fact: I pick up new environments really quick as I think alogorithmically and then fit the same to the language/platform required!... So feel free to reach out for languages not in my portfolio if the algorithmic requirements match!
